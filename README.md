## 🎨 Installation

### Option 1: Using Jellyfin’s Custom CSS

1. Go to your **Jellyfin Admin Dashboard**
2. Navigate to: `Dashboard > General > Custom CSS`
3. Paste the contents of [`lcars-theme.css`](./lcars-theme.css) into the field
4. Save and refresh the page

### Option 2: Host as External CSS File

1. Save `lcars-theme.css` on your web server
2. Use browser extensions like **Stylus** to load the theme locally  
3. (Optional) Modify the font path in the CSS to match your hosting environment

## 🔤 Fonts

The theme is designed to use the **LCARS Terminal** or **Okuda** font.

- [LCARS Terminal Font (Free)](https://github.com/remixz/trekkie/blob/master/resources/fonts/LCARS.ttf)
- Include the font with:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'LCARS Terminal';
  src: url('/fonts/lcars.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```

⚠️ You will need to host the font yourself or use a local path.

## ⚙️ Customization Tips

- Modify the color palette in the CSS to suit your variant (e.g., Voyager vs. TNG styles)
- You can add `.lcars-segment` and `.lcars-panel` classes in HTML widgets or browser extensions for enhanced LCARS-like decor
- To extend the theme into mobile views, add media queries
